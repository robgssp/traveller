# traveller world generator

generate worlds. it's rough right now. just run it and you will make 10 random
worlds that will probably match the way the book describes generating them,
printed in debug format. there are no tweaks or hints for things to do, and the
worlds aren't linked in any way to the subsector map.

hi rob!
